# break-it-check — the mandatory anti-theater gate

**This gate is mandatory. No phase latches without it.** Execute mode's step 4
is `break-it-check`, invoked between "write the tests for this phase" and
"write `Landed:` and commit" — nothing skips it, and nothing writes `Landed:`
without it passing.

It discharges *"the test suite should fail loudly when you fix bugs."* For
each behavior named on the phase's `Catches:` line: inject that bug into a
**disposable copy** of the production code, confirm the new test goes red,
discard the copy.

The mechanism is adapted from `verification-before-completion/SKILL.md:84-88`:

```
Write → Run (pass) → Inject bug → Run (MUST FAIL) → Discard copy → Run (pass)
```

with two inversions from that skill: there is no fix to revert — the bug is
**injected** into working code — and the injection happens in a throwaway
`git worktree`, so nothing in the developer's tree is ever at risk (Inviolate
#2: production code is never permanently modified).

## Protocol

Six steps, in order. The order is load-bearing — steps 1 and 2 each protect
against a failure mode that only shows up if they run first.

1. **Sweep, then create one worktree for the phase.** First reclaim any strand
   left by a crashed or aborted prior run:

   - `git worktree prune` — reclaims only records whose checkout directory is
     already gone; it cannot touch a live worktree.
   - Enumerate `git worktree list --porcelain`, **filter to paths under
     `.git/test-roadmap-worktrees/`, and force-remove only those.**

   The filter-to-prefix is the whole guarantee here. This is **not** "remove
   all worktrees" — that would be wrong, because a developer may have their
   own hand-made worktree checked out elsewhere on the same repo, and this
   sweep must never touch it. The prefix is fixed and lives inside `.git`, so
   the sweep can identify its own worktrees by path alone and nothing it
   creates ever lands in the working tree.

   Then create the phase's worktree: `git worktree add
   .git/test-roadmap-worktrees/<phase> HEAD`.

   This worktree is **reused across the baseline run and every mutation in
   the phase** — one worktree per phase, not one per mutation. That reuse is
   structural, not an optimization to skip if time-pressed: a fresh checkout
   excludes gitignored artifacts (no `node_modules/`, `target/`, no venv), and
   the skill cannot know, language-agnostically, what install command would
   repopulate them or how long it takes. Paying that cost once per phase
   instead of once per mutation is the only mitigation available that doesn't
   require hardcoding an ecosystem's build tooling.

2. **Copy the phase's new test files into the worktree, *then* mutate.**
   Never the other way around. In colocated-test ecosystems — Rust's
   `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` is the reproduced case — the test file *is* the
   production file. If the mutation were applied first and the test copied
   in second, the copy would silently overwrite the mutation: the test would
   stay green, and the gate would misread a mutation that was never actually
   applied as a theater test. Copy-then-mutate is the only order that can't
   erase its own injected bug.

3. **Baseline run.** Run the phase's own tests, unmutated, in the worktree.
   They **must pass**, and the result must be **stable across two runs**. See
   the *Failure table* below for what each way of failing this step means —
   do not proceed past a baseline that isn't clean green and stable.

4. **Per behavior on `Catches:`, inject one mutation via a blind mutator
   subagent.** The subagent receives:

   - the `Catches:` behavior text,
   - the production file,
   - the worktree path,
   - the operator list (below),

   and explicitly **not the test**. It returns one hunk. The main agent
   applies the **first** hunk returned, runs the phase's own tests, and
   checks for red. There is no re-rolling for a more convenient hunk — see
   *Constrained mutation* for why.

   Blinding the subagent to the test is the point: a subagent that can see
   the test could tune the mutation to whatever the test happens to check,
   which reintroduces the exact failure mode this gate exists to catch — the
   same author writing both the test and the thing meant to indict it.

5. **`git worktree remove --force`.** `--force` is required, not optional —
   the worktree is unclean by construction (the copied-in test is untracked,
   the injected mutation is a tracked-file modification), and a bare
   `git worktree remove` refuses an unclean worktree, telling you to pass
   `--force`. There is nothing to restore, nothing to stage, no fence to
   satisfy first: this is only the fast path. Step 1's sweep is the
   guarantee — see *Why a disposable worktree* below.

6. **Commit only after the check passes**, on the developer's real tree. The
   operator name(s) used are echoed to the transcript and recorded on the
   phase's `Landed:` line as provenance.

**"Run the test" means the phase's own tests, not the whole suite**, at every
step above. Mutating production code *should* break unrelated tests — that's
expected, not signal — so there's no reason to run the full suite here, and a
legacy suite's pre-existing failures stay out of frame.

## Constrained mutation

The injected mutation is not free-form. It is a single change drawn from a
named operator set, and the subagent must **declare which operator by
name** when it returns its hunk:

- flip a comparison (`<` ↔ `<=`, `==` ↔ `!=`)
- off-by-one a boundary
- negate a condition
- alter a constant
- drop a state transition

**Explicitly banned, regardless of operator name:**

- an early `return` / `raise` / `throw` at function entry
- removing a whole function body

These two are banned by shape, not by judgment call, because they are
sledgehammers: either one makes *any* test go red — including a theater test
like `assert result is not None` — which would let a genuinely worthless test
pass the gate for the wrong reason. "Keep the mutation small" is a
rationalizable instruction; "no early return at function entry" is a concrete
line an agent cannot talk itself around. Requiring the operator to be named
turns a dishonest mutation into an affirmative written claim instead of a
silent choice.

**If the first hunk leaves the test green, that is the theater row in the
table below — rewrite the test. Do not re-roll the mutation.** Re-rolling
would let the main agent shop for a hunk that happens to turn the test red,
which quietly restores the identity the blind-mutator subagent exists to
break: one author controlling both the test and the thing meant to indict
it. A test that survives one honest, named mutation attempt on the behavior
it claims to cover has already told you what it needs to tell you.

## Failure table

Five outcomes. Each is a different failure of a different precondition the
gate depends on, and each has one correct action — never "fix the code" and
never "latch anyway."

| Outcome | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline red (fails unmutated, run alone) — but green in a full-suite run | **Order dependence**, not a mischaracterization: the test relies on state another test sets up. The isolated gate cannot judge it. | **Surface it. The phase cannot use the isolated gate as-is.** Do not latch, do not "fix" the code. |
| Baseline red (fails unmutated) — and also red in a full-suite run | The test does not describe current behavior — **mischaracterization**. | **Rewrite the test.** Do not fix the code, do not latch. |
| Baseline result unstable across two runs | The test is **flaky** — its verdict is noise, so the gate cannot judge it. | **Surface it.** Do not latch. |
| No code path implements this `Catches:` behavior (no valid site to inject) | The phase was planned against code that has since moved or vanished. | **Phase invalidated — re-plan it.** Do not latch. |
| Mutation applied, test stayed green | **Theater** — the test does not catch what the phase claims. | **Rewrite the test.** Do not latch. Do not re-roll the mutation. |

**"Run the test" in every row above means the phase's own tests, not the
whole suite.** The order-dependence and flaky rows exist because the
isolated gate silently *depends on* the phase's tests being isolable and
deterministic — this table is where those two preconditions get checked,
and where a violation of either gets named and surfaced rather than papered
over. Naming the violation is the whole of this gate's engagement with
suite health; it detects the two failure modes, it does not repair them.

The "no code path" row is the design's staleness detector: a bug cannot be
injected into a code path that has moved or vanished, and no phase latches
without passing this gate — so a stale plan gets caught here, not silently
latched against a `Produces:` path that no longer means what it once did.

## Why a disposable worktree, not an in-tree mutation

An earlier draft mutated the developer's working tree directly and protected
it with an elaborate write-fence: a whole-tree `git status --porcelain`
snapshot compared before and after each mutation, plus a
`git add`-before-`git checkout` staging dance to survive `git checkout`'s
restore-from-index behavior. Roughly forty lines of protocol existed solely
to make an in-tree mutation survivable — and it still had a window: a crash,
context exhaustion, or a `--watch` runner mid-mutation could leave altered
production code on disk, caught only on the *next* run, after the developer
already had it in front of them.

The worktree deletes the problem instead of fencing it. The mutated copy is
disposable, so there is no invariant left to protect: no snapshot
comparison, no staging, no path-based fence — and the colocated-test hazard
that broke every such fence (in Rust/Zig/D the test file *is* under `src/`)
becomes irrelevant, because you're mutating a copy you're about to throw
away regardless.

The same kind of crash the write-fence could not survive can still strand
the **worktree itself** — the disposable checkout, plus its
`.git/worktrees/` record — on any exit that skips step 5: a failure-table
short-circuit, context exhaustion, a `--watch` runner, a hard kill. That is
hygiene, not a safety gap — the developer's tree is never touched either
way, so Inviolate #2 holds regardless of whether step 5 ever runs — but the
leak this time is closed the way the write-fence's window was **not**: on
the next entry, never on the current exit. Step 1's sweep (`git worktree
prune`, plus a force-remove filtered to test-roadmap's own prefix) runs on
the one path a crash cannot skip — the start of the next run — so a strand
left by a dead session dies at the start of the next one instead of
persisting indefinitely. On-exit removal (step 5) is only the fast path;
the sweep is the guarantee, because no on-exit cleanup survives a crash this
design already declined to trust once.

The cost, stated honestly: a fresh worktree starts with no `node_modules/`,
no `target/`, no venv, no `_build/`. Some ecosystems need a full dependency
install before their tests can even run, and that can cost minutes. This
skill cannot know the install command stack-agnostically, so the mitigation
here is structural, not a lookup table — one worktree per phase, reused
across every mutation in that phase (protocol step 1) — never a built-in
per-language command table.
